		<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

		<h4>Can I try CloudCannon for free?</h4>
		<p>
			Yes, signing up for CloudCannon starts a free 30 day trial on the <strong>Pro</strong> plan.
			During this trial period you can enter a credit card and select a plan if you'd like to continue using CloudCannon.
		</p>

		<h4>What happens after the 30 day trial?</h4>
		<p>
			If you haven't added a credit card and selected a plan, you'll be downgraded to our free plan.
			The free plan restricts access to your sites and removes all the shares you've made.
		</p>

		<h4>Can I switch plans?</h4>
		<p>Yes, change your plan any time in <em>Account Settings</em>.</p>

		<h4>Do I pay for another user when sharing to a client?</h4>
		<p>No, sharing with <a href="https://docs.cloudcannon.com/sharing/client-sharing/" target="_blank">Client Sharing</a> does not count towards your total users.</p>

		<h4>How am I billed when adding new users?</h4>
		<p>
			CloudCannon adds a prorated charge (or refund when removing a user) to your next invoice.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, it costs $25 per user per month. You add a new team member 10 days into your billing period and there are 20 remaining days in the month.
			The per-day cost for each user is $25 &divide; 30, so we add on ~$16.60 ($25 &divide; 30 days &times; 20 days) to your next invoice.
		</p>

		<h4>Do you take feature requests?</h4>
		<p>Yes, we listen closely to our customers. <a href="mailto:support@cloudcannon.com">Contact support</a> if you have requests or feedback. Many CloudCannon features are driven by your feedback.</p>

		<h4>Where are CloudCannon sites hosted?</h4>
		<p>
			CloudCannon uses Amazon Web Services for all infrastructure.
			Sites are automatically optimised and served from our custom <em>File Server</em>.
			Optimisations include GZIP, serving assets from a CDN and minification.
		</p>
		<p>
			CloudCannon supports <a href="https://docs.cloudcannon.com/hosting/options/" target="_blank">other hosting options</a>, including your own servers.
		</p>

		<h4>How do I cancel my CloudCannon account?</h4>
		<p>Either downgrade to the free plan or delete your account. Find these options in your <em>Account Settings</em>.</p>
